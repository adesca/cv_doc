#Taking a Screenshot
Taking a Screenshot in CVOS is very easy, but slightly different from what you might expect.

Pressing `PrtScr` will take a screenshot of your entire desktop, and save the image in a file in your home folder.  This image will have a name similar to `2038-01-19-131407_3200x1080_scrot.png`

Alternatively, pressing `Alt-PrtScr` will take a screenshot of only your currently selected window, and will save that image in a file in your home folder.  This image will also have a name similar to `2038-01-19-131407_644x511_scrot.png`

##Shutter
Shutter is a powerful screen-capturing tool, which allows you to capture any screen or window, run plugins, and more.  Shutter can be found in `"Application Menu" > "Accessories" > "Shutter"`
