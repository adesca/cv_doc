##Firefox
Firefox is available on CVOS under `"Application Menu > Internet > Firefox Web Browser"`

Firefox looks much the same as Firefox, with the exception of a customized start page and a slightly different appearance.  For more information, please visit [Firefox Documentation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox)

##Google Chrome
CV Admins understand and appreciate the value of the Google Chrome internet browser. To this end, we are working hard to add it to our suite of installed software. Unfortunately, we are waiting to confirm full support before it can be released for general consumption.  Google Chrome will add support for Netflix.
