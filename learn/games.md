#The saga of games

The admins like to game just as much as the rest of the lounge, however, priorities have to be set and with looming deadlines, work always takes precedence.  This unfortunately means that the vast majority of games are not currently installed on the lounge computers.  Rest assured that there are plans to fully restore many if not all of the games to the lounge computers.

It is generally a safe assumption that most games older than 4 years will run with minimal work.  The newer games require work but this work is an interesting challenge that admins are happy to take on.  If you'd like to help, look up information about running your game on Ubuntu and have this ready when you ask an admin, they'll need it to install your game.

Of course, if you buy games in the Humble Bundle, many are already supported with no additional work.  Any requests for games should be made according to the normal [contributing guidelines](/contribute/).
