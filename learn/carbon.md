Carbon is the lounge SSH jump host.  If you don't know what that means, you probably have no use for it.  In short Carbon allows you to establish a secure connection to the lounge network, as well as run certain low-overhead text mode programs such as an IRC client.

To connect to Carbon you will need to install a public key.

To install a public key run at any terminal prompt:

`modpubkey`

This command will open your editor of choice with an authorized_keys file.  Save and close to update your new public key.

Users with existing keys can continue to use their keys with no interruption.
