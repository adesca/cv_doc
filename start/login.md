## Log in to a Lounge Workstation

1. Enter your username and password at the prompt, and press enter.

2. If your username and password were incorrect, there will be a lengthy pause.
 - After this pause, you will be informed that your password was wrong.

3. If your username and password correct, there will be a short pause.
 - After this pause, you will be treated with a desktop background in a few 
   seconds.

4. If you are convinced your username and password are correct, and you are 
   not logging in successfully, try resetting your password.

### Locking
If you leave your workstation alone for 10 minutes, while logged in, your 
session will be locked with a screensaver. You may simply wiggle your mouse or 
press any key to be given a password prompt.

Power users may lock their workstation with the command: ``xscreensaver --lock``
