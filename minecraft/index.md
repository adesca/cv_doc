##Minecraft

Collegium V maintains a minecraft server for use by CV students.  This server is publicly accessible at minecraft.collegiumv.org.  Both survival and creative gameplay are available.

The process to connect and play is as follows:

1. Own a copy of Minecraft
2. Load version 1.8.7 in your client.
3. Connect to minecraft.collegiumv.org
4. If its your first time playing, get your account verified.
5. Use the "/server" command to connect to either the survival or creative environments.

Some things to keep in mind while playing:

1. If its your first time on the server, you have to be verified by an administrator, ping the user "maldridge" and be patient.
2. Minecraft chat is mirrored to IRC and vice versa, please be respectful of any people talking.
3. Griefing is not tolerated.
4. The standard rules of the lounge apply and will be enforced.

##General Rules

* If you didn't build it, don't break it.

##Trivia!
No server would be complete without some trivia, here's ours:

##In the beginning...

###The Pyramid
The spawn pyramid in creative was built entirely by [Adifex] and was built with no editing tools.

* The pyramid contains the basic rules of the server as initially drafted.
* The pyramid connects to the roads leading out to all reaches of the server.

###Green Center
Green center was started by [Adifex] and completed by the community.

* No editing tools were used to build it.
* The model is accurate to within 2 meters real distance.
* Green Center's file is available upon request.

###Giant Compass
The giant compass exists to the north of the spawn pyramid.

* The flat pit was blasted clear with TNT
* The initial placement of the glowstone was done by hand.


##More Recent Times...

###Atlantis
Atlantis is an underwater city currently spearheaded by [Architekton_Vade].

* This underwater city relies heavily on world editing tools.
* Elliptical Glass views offer a unique building environment where careful consideration is required to not destroy the surrounding region.
