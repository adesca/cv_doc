#Update
Printing has been updated to improve performance and stability.  For the most part, this update will be seemlessly integrated into your experience.  However, the program `okular` has been found to be a culprit in the slowness of the printers.  Therefore we recommend against using it, and instead recommend any of the following programs. (We are working to add more to this list)

* Google Chrome - `google-chrome`
* Firefox - `firefox`

For advanced users, the `lpr` command will offer nearly instantaneous printing in most circumstances.  You can use it as follows:

```
lpr <document> -P Carlson
```

#Printing
CV Admins knows that printing is chief among the concerns of Lounge users.  We cannot claim that the experience will be completely bug free, however it is our firm belief that this upgrade has improved the stability of printing in the long term.

Printing documents functions exactly as it does in other operating systems.  `File > Print` is the most common location for this command.  In addition, the key combination `Ctrl`+`P` works in many places.

#Document Viewer
Printing from `Document Viewer` will not work.  We are investigating the issue and apologize for any inconvenience.

#Paper
The CV Lounge does not charge users for printing.  Instead, we work on a "Paper Balance" - you must bring in paper (unopened reams only please!) to the CV Offices.  CV Admins prefer `92 Bright, 20lb` paper in ream sizes of `500 sheets` (or larger if you must).  We will of course accept smaller reams as well, however. Unfortunately we cannot credit you for legal paper, construction paper, card stock, or any other specialty paper (our printers and admins are very picky...)

#Papercut
CV Admins has deployed a current paper balance dialogue box onto the CVOS machines. As always, your balance can be accessed via the PaperCut interface at [paper.collegiumv.org](http://paper.collegiumv.org)
