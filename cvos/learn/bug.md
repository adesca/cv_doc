Any large project can have some bugs.  While CVOS has undergone many iterations to try and iron out the bugs, there are probably still some left.  If you happen to come across a bug, please follow the steps below:

 1. Ensure that you found a bug.
   * Sometimes things that look like bugs aren't bugs.
   * See if you can duplicate the issue on another computer.
 2. See if this is a known bug.
   * Check the CVOS issue tracker, or the Ubuntu issue tracker.
   * Check the software author's website, if applicable.
 3. See if there is a fix available.
 4. Report the bug, including any information you found from above.
   * It is preferred that you file a ticket yourself in the CVOS issue tracker located [here](http://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client/issues/).
   * If you are unable to file the bug, please let an admin know so that they can make a note of the bug.


With informative bug reports, CVOS can quickly become a highly reliable system capable of filling all of the lounge needs and more.
