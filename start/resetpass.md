# Reset Password

## If you do not have an account, or do not know your password, follow these steps.

1. Visit [account.collegiumv.org](https://account.collegiumv.org)
 - There is a computer placed next to the Recycling Bin inside the Lounge 
   dedicated to this, for your convenience.

2. Enter your Net ID in the box, and press "Change Password" (after the button 
   appears).
 - If the button does not appear, check your Net ID again. An example Net ID, 
   properly formatted, would be: "abc123123".
 - Do not press the button multiple times. Doing so, even if the page seems 
   unresponsive, will lead to your password being reset multiple times as well.
   If you do press the button multiple times, just remember that you did, and 
   move on.

3. Check your UT Dallas Email.
 - If you use Office 365, you can check your email 
   [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/).
 - If you are a Zmail user, you can check your email 
   [here](https://zmail.utdallas.edu/).
 - You will see an email giving you a link to finish the reset process.
 - **If you pressed "Change Password" more than once**, the email sent the most 
   recently will contain the correct link.

4. Press the link provided in the email.
 - This must be done within one hour.
 - You will be taken to a page with the line of text "Your password has been 
   emailed to you."
 - If you see "An error occurred, perhaps you have an old link?" then you should 
   start again from step 1.

5. Check your email again.
 - This time, the email will include your temporary password.

6. [Log in](login.html) to a Lounge Workstation with your temporary password.

7. [Change your password](changepass.html).
