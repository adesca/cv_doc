If there is software you'd like installed, but isn't currently installed, there are a few short steps to quickly have your software installed.

 1. Try running your program (it might just work).
 2. See if there is a version of your program for Debian derived systems.
 3. See if your program is listed [here](http://appdb.winehq.org).
 4. File a ticket [here](http://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client/issues/).
 5. Be sure to include as much information as possible and ask an admin if you have any questions.

That's all there is to it.  One thing to remember though: requests for academic software will always take priority over games or other non-school focused software.
