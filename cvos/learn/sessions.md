If you wish to change your default session from the Lubuntu Desktop Environment, run `modsession` at any client terminal prompt.

This command will open a list of options, simply select your desired session and press enter.

If you wish to try a session before you switch, there is a hidden dropdown in the bottom left-most corner of the login window.  On hover, it will become visible.

At the time of this writing the following shells are available:

* Lubuntu (The default desktop environment)
* cinnamon (A Windows like experience)
* xfce (An alternative minimal desktop environment with a mac-like dock)
* openbox (A very minimal experience)
* i3 (A tiling window manager)
* awesome (A tiling window manager)
