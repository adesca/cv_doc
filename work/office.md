Productivity has been our foremost concern while upgrading Lounge computer resources. To this end, we provide a full suite of office tools which can be combined with University resources to great effect.

##LibreOffice
LibreOffice is a suite of software much like Microsoft Office. LibreOffice is available via the Application Menu under "Office".

 * LibreOffice Writer: A document editor much like Microsoft Word
 * LibreOffice Calc: A spreadsheet tool much like Microsoft Excel
 * LibreOffice Impress: A slideshow creator similar to Microsoft Powerpoint
 * LibreOffice Base: A database solution akin to Microsoft Access.

###It is important to be aware of your filetype when saving in LibreOffice. The traditional `.doc` or `.docx` formats are available but are not the defaults.
