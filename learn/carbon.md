Carbon is the lounge SSH jump host.  If you don't know what that means, you probably have no use for it.  In short Carbon allows you to establish a secure connection to the lounge network, as well as run certain low-overhead text mode programs such as an IRC client.

To connect to Carbon you will need to install a public key, due to ongoing upgrades and maintenance this is not currently possible.  This page will be updated with further instructions once this process is again possible.

Users with existing keys can continue to use their keys with no interruption.
