#Office
Productivity has been our foremost concern while upgrading Lounge computer resources. To this end, we provide a full suite of office tools which can be combined with University resources to great effect.

##LibreOffice
LibreOffice is a suite of software much like Microsoft Office. LibreOffice is available via the Application Menu under "Office".

 * LibreOffice Writer: A document editor much like Microsoft Word
 * LibreOffice Calc: A spreadsheet tool much like Microsoft Excel
 * LibreOffice Impress: A slideshow creator similar to Microsoft Powerpoint
 * LibreOffice Base: A database solution akin to Microsoft Access.

###It is important to be aware of your filetype when saving in LibreOffice. The traditional `.doc` or `.docx` formats are available but are not the defaults.

##Office 365
The University of Texas at Dallas provides all students with access to Microsoft Office 365, which works very nearly identically to conventional Microsoft Office products. You can access it at [portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)

##Google Documents
Google Documents is another online office solution.  It is accessible with a Google account and a web browser at [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com) .

##WPS Office
WPS Office is an office suite that appears very similar to newer versions of Microsoft Office.  Some users may find this more familiar to work with.

###Due to the nature of the source model and license WPS Office uses, this suite is provided as-is, and may be removed from CVOS at any time.  It is encouraged that students take some time to use one of the above options, which we have throuroughly tested and analyzed, and are guaranteed to be supported in the future.

WPS Office provides three utilities, available via the Application Menu under "Office".

 * WPS Writer: A document editor much like Microsoft Word 2013
 * WPS Spreadsheets: A spreadsheet tool much like Microsoft Excel 2013
 * WPS Presentation: A slideshow creater similar to Microsoft Powerpoint 2013

###It is important to be aware of your filetype when saving in WPS Office.  The default file format, `.wps`, cannot be read by Microsoft Word.  Be sure to select Microsoft Word 2007/2010 Document to save as a `.docx`, to preserve compatability with other office suites.

You can set the default filetype for saving so that you never have to change this setting again by following the following steps:

Open WPS Writer. Click the blue `Writer` menu. Click on `Options.
