#Get involved

CVOS is a collaborative effort developed by the students of CV.  If there's something you want to change or add to the system, do it!  The admins strive to maintain a low barrier of entry for helping out and whether your skills are grounded in technology, humanities, or health and medicine, we appreciate your unique viewpoint and insight to improve the project.
